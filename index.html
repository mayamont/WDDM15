        <p  id="textp" class = "text">I am a proactive Data Analyst with a proven track record of driving impactful insights through technical expertise. Currently expanding my horizons by pursuing studies in Web Design and Development at Humber College in Toronto. In my most recent position as a Data Analyst, I specialized in Wealth Management at BTG Pactual. Proficient in financial concepts including Revenue, NNM, and AUM, I harnessed my technical skills in PySpark, SQL, Power BI, and AWS tools to facilitate perceptive analysis and reporting. Leading a pivotal project, I orchestrated data consolidation for daily metric tracking, collaborating cross-functionally to ensure data integrity and deliver invaluable insights. My enthusiasm lies in translating data into strategic decisions, reinforcing BTG Pactual Wealth Management success. At TERA, I strategically devised roadmaps, extracted and refined data, and generated comprehensive reports using SQL, BigQuery, Tableau, and Google Apps Script. Collaborating with stakeholders, I played a pivotal role in shaping long-term growth strategies rooted in data insights, while meticulously documenting user-centric requirements. In my initial role as an Automation and Business Intelligence Solutions Developer at DXC Technology, I excelled in leveraging Microsoft Power BI, SQL, C#, and WinAutomation to drive data-powered solutions. My direct collaboration with internal stakeholders involved understanding business needs, designing BI solutions, and delivering quantitative analyses that translated intricate data into actionable strategies. Throughout my journey, I have consistently demonstrated an adept analytical mindset, technical prowess, and an unwavering commitment to informed decision-making. My passion lies in delivering tangible results through data-driven approaches. Open to new challenges and opportunities that allow me to blend my expertise with innovative solutions!</p>
